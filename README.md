# Exploratory Electric Vehicle Analysis
“An exploratory analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI to uncover insights on battery performance, cost efficiency, resale value, environmental impact, and regional adoption trends.”

**Introduction**

The global shift toward sustainable transportation has driven widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs). This project analyses EV-related datasets to uncover insights into performance, cost, efficiency, and environmental impact. Using data-driven analysis, I aimed to understand factors influencing EV adoption, energy consumption, resale value, and CO₂ savings across regions, usage types, and vehicle categories. To support better decision-making for manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers, this project explores key insights from EV datasets.
