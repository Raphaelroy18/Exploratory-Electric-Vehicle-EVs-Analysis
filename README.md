# Exploratory Electric Vehicle Analysis
‚ÄúAn exploratory analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI to uncover insights on battery performance, cost efficiency, resale value, environmental impact, and regional adoption trends.‚Äù

***Introduction***

The global shift toward sustainable transportation has driven widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs). This project analyses EV-related datasets to uncover insights into performance, cost, efficiency, and environmental impact. Using data-driven analysis, I aimed to understand factors influencing EV adoption, energy consumption, resale value, and CO‚ÇÇ savings across regions, usage types, and vehicle categories. To support better decision-making for manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers, this project explores key insights from EV datasets.

**Project Overview**

This project analysis a dataset containing performance, cost, and environmental indicators for electric vehicles, such as:
‚Ä¢	 Battery capacity, health, and driving range
‚Ä¢	 Maintenance and insurance costs
‚Ä¢	 CO‚ÇÇ savings across regions and usage types
‚Ä¢	 Resale values by brand and region
‚Ä¢	 Performance indicators such as acceleration and max speed

The dataset used in this project was sourced from kaggle [download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/electric-vehicle-analytics-dataset)


 **Dataset Overview**

‚Ä¢	Rows: 3,000

‚Ä¢	Columns: 25

‚Ä¢	Scope: Covers technical, economic, and usage details of electric vehicles across regions and brands

 **Project Objectives**

1.	Assess EV performance through metrics such as battery capacity, range, acceleration, and max speed.
2.	Evaluate operational costs including maintenance and insurance across regions and usage types.
3.	Explore environmental impact by analysing CO‚ÇÇ savings.
4.	Compare resale values across vehicle brands and regions.
5.	Identify trends in energy efficiency and whether faster cars consume more energy.
6.	Provide actionable insights for policymakers, manufacturers, and EV consumers.

**Why Choose This Particular Dataset for this Analysis?**

This dataset was chosen because it provides a holistic view of electric vehicles, combining:
‚Ä¢	Technical aspects (battery, range, charging, speed).
‚Ä¢	Economic factors (maintenance, insurance, charging cost, resale value).
‚Ä¢	Environmental impact (CO‚ÇÇ savings).
‚Ä¢	Regional & usage diversity (personal, commercial, fleet vehicles across multiple continents).

üõ† **Tools Used**
‚Ä¢	Microsoft Excel ‚Üí Data cleaning, handling missing values, and initial formatting.
‚Ä¢	SQL ‚Üí Querying large datasets, filtering, and aggregating records for analysis.
‚Ä¢	Power BI ‚Üí Building interactive dashboards with KPIs, maps, charts, and advanced visuals.

Key Insights
1.	Maintenance & Insurance Costs:
o	Asia and Australia recorded the highest maintenance costs, while insurance costs fluctuated year-to-year but showed an upward trend.

2.	Battery & Range Performance:
o	The average battery capacity was ~75 kWh, supporting ranges above 1 million km across the dataset.
o	Battery health averaged 85%, reflecting good long-term durability.

3.	Environmental Impact:
o	EVs saved 45,000+ tons of CO‚ÇÇ, with Asia and North America leading in environmental benefits.
o	Usage type analysis showed all categories (Personal, Fleet, Commercial) contribute significantly to emission savings.

4.	Resale Market:
o	Brands like Tesla, Ford, and BMW hold the highest resale values.
o	Regionally, North America and Asia dominate the resale market.
